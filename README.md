# Collab: Rapid Prototyping for Museums üèõÔ∏è

This is the course I take in Spring 2018 taught by Brad MacDonald (http://www.bradmack.com/).

### üöÄ Course Description
The National Museum of Natural History is currently in the early development phase of an upcoming exhibition, Unseen Connections, which is scheduled to open in 2021. Unseen Connections focuses on the cultural and global impacts that cellphone brought upon our lives. This exhibition offers an unprecedented opportunity to leverage 1) technology to enrich visitors experience in the Museum and 2) the relationship between NMNH and Parsons' Design and Technology Program. While NMNH excels as storytelling in the exhibition space and offers world-class research and extensive collections, the participation by Parsons DT faculty and students will enhance the exhibition through the following: ‚Ä¢ Extensive experience with the intersection of new media and narrative in a diversity of applications and through iterative prototyping with a culture of product design and build ‚Ä¢ An invaluable "outsiders" perspective on effective exhibit development process We propose a series of 5 workshops to be hosted at the Parsons in the fall of 2017. Brad MacDonald (Parsons) will lead the participants from Parsons and the exhibit core team for Unseen Connections with the following goals in mind: ‚Ä¢ Familiarize Parsons participants with NMNH exhibition development process and the mission of the Museum at large ‚Ä¢ Brainstorm applications of new media that enhance the message and educational goals of Unseen Connections, with priority on creativity and feasibility for implementation ‚Ä¢ Rapidly prototype 5 to 10 potential media and interactive elements for the exhibition ‚Ä¢ Recommend a subset of prototypes for further development and implementation in the exhibition space by fall of 2019.
